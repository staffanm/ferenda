  <Section title="First section">
    <Paragraph>
      <str>This is a regular paragraph. It will not be matched by is_section
(unlike the above chunk) or is_preformatted (unlike the below chunk),
but by the catch-all is_paragraph. The recognizers are run in the
order specified by FSMParser.set_transitions().</str>
    </Paragraph>
    <Preformatted>
      <str>    This is a preformatted section.
        It could be used for source code,
    +-------------------+
    |   line drawings   |
    +-------------------+
        or what have                 you.</str>

  <Section title="Second section">
    <Paragraph>
      <str>The above new section implicitly closed the first section which we
were in. This was made explicit by the last transition rule, which
stated that any time a section is encountered while in the "section"
state, we should not create any more children (False) but instead
return to our previous state (which in this case is "body", but for a
more complex language could be any number of states).</str>
