Key concepts
============


Project
-------

A collection of docrepos and configuration that is used to make a
useful web site. The first step in creating a project is running
``ferenda-setup <projectname>``.

A project is primarily defined by its configuration file at
``<projectname>/ferenda.ini``, which specifies which docrepos are
used, and settings for them as well as settings for the entire
project.

A project is managed using the ``ferenda-build.py`` tool.

If using the API instead of these command line tools, there is no concept
of a project except for what your code provides. Your client code
is responsible for creating the docrepo classes and providing them with
proper settings. These can be loaded from a ``ferenda.ini``-style file
(the :class:`~ferenda.LayeredConfig` class makes this simple), be
hard-coded, or handled in any other way you see fit.

.. _configuration:

Configuration
-------------

A ferenda docrepo object can be configured in two ways - either when
creating the object, eg:

.. code-block:: py

  d = DocumentSource(datadir="mydata", loglevel="DEBUG",force=True)

.. note::

   Parameters that is not provided when creating the object are
   defaulted from the built-in configuration values (see below)
  
Or it can be configured using the :py:class:`~ferenda.LayeredConfig`
class, which takes configuration data from three places:

* built-in configuration values (provided by
  :py:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentRepository.get_default_options`)
* values from a configuration file (normally ``ferenda.ini``", placed
  alongside ``ferenda-build.py``)
* command-line parameters, eg ``--force --datadir=mydata``

.. code-block:: py
  
  d = DocumentSource()
  d.config = LayeredConfig(defaults=d.get_default_options(), 
                           inifile="ferenda.ini", 
                           commandline=sys.argv)
  
(This is what ``ferenda-build.py`` does behind the scenes)

Configuration values from the configuration file overrides built-in
configuration values, and command line parameters override
configuration file values.

By setting the ``config`` property, you override any parameters provided when
creating the object.

.. note::

   Because of reasons, after re-setting the ``config`` property, you
   also need to re-set the ``store`` property. For now, look at the
   source code for ``_instantiate_class`` in ``ferenda/manager.py`` to
   learn how it's done. 

These are the normal configuration options:

DocumentRepository
------------------

A document repository (docrepo for short) is a class that handles all
aspects of a document collection: Downloading the documents (or
aquiring them in some other way), parsing them into structured
documents, and then re-generating HTML documents with added niceties,
for example references from documents from other docrepos.

You add support for a new collection of documents by subclassing
:py:class:`~ferenda.DocumentRepository`. For more
details, see :doc:`createdocrepos`

Document
--------

A :py:class:`~ferenda.Document` is the main unit of information in
Ferenda. A document is primarily represented in serialized form as a
XHTML 1.1 file with embedded metadata in RDFa format, and in code by
the :py:class:`~ferenda.Document` class. The class has five
properties:

* ``meta`` (a RDFLib :py:class:`~rdflib.graph.Graph`)
* ``body`` (a tree of building blocks, normally instances of
  :py:mod:`ferenda.elements` classes, representing the structure and
  content of the document)
* ``lang`` (an `IETF language
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag>`_ tag, eg ``sv`` or
  ``en-GB``)
* ``uri`` (a string representing the canonical URI for this document)
* ``basefile`` (a short internal id)

The method :py:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentRepository.render_xhtml` (which
is called automatically, as long as your ``parse`` method use the
:py:func:`~ferenda.decorators.managedparsing` decorator) renders a
:py:class:`~ferenda.Document` object into a XHTML 1.1+RDFa document.

Identifiers
-----------

Documents, and parts of documents, in ferenda have a couple of
different identifiers, and it's useful to understand the difference
and relation between them.

* ``basefile``: The *internal id* for a document. This is is internal
  to the document repository and is used as the base for the filenames
  for the stored files . The basefile isn't totally random and is
  expected to have some relationship with a human-readable identifier
  for the document. As an example from the RFC docrepo, the basefile
  for RFC 1147 would simply be "1147". By the rules encoded in
  :py:class:`~ferenda.DocumentStore`, this results in the downloaded
  file ``rfc/downloads/1147.txt``, the parsed file
  ``rfc/parsed/1147.xhtml`` and the generated file
  ``rfc/generated/1147.html``. Only documents themselves, not parts of
  documents, have basefile identifiers.

* ``uri``: The *canonical URI* for a document **or** a part of a
  document (generally speaking, a *resource*). This identifier is used
  when storing data related to the resource in a triple store and a
  fulltext search engine, and is also used as the external URL for the
  document when republishing (see :doc:`wsgi` and also
  :ref:`parsing-uri`). URI:s for documents can be set by settings the
  ``uri`` property of the Document object.  URIs for parts of
  documents are set by setting the ``uri`` property on any
  :py:mod:`~ferenda.elements` based object in the body tree. When
  rendering the document into XHTML, render_xhtml creates RDFa
  statements based on this property and the ``meta`` property.

* ``dct:identifier``: The *human readable* identifier for a document
  or a part of a document. If the document has an established
  human-readable identifier, such as "RFC 1147" or "2003/98/EC" (The
  EU directive on the re-use of public sector information), the
  dct:identifier is used for this. Unlike ``basefile`` and ``uri``,
  this identifier isn't set directly as a property on an
  object. Instead, you add a triple with ``dct:identifier`` as the
  predicate to the object's ``meta`` property, see :doc:`docmetadata`
  and also `DCMI Terms
  <http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-identifier>`_.
 
DocumentEntry
-------------

Apart from information about what a document contains, there is also
information about how it has been handled, such as when a document was
first downloaded or updated from a remote source, the URL from where
it came, and when it was made available through Ferenda. .This
information is encapsulated in the :py:class:`~ferenda.DocumentEntry`
class.  Such objects are created and updated by various methods in
:py:class:`~ferenda.DocumentRepository`. The objects are persisted to
JSON files, stored alongside the documents themselves, and are used by
the :py:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentRepository.news` method in order to
create valid Atom feeds.


File storage
------------

During the course of processing, data about each individual document
is stored in many different files in various formats. The
:class:`~ferenda.DocumentStore` class handles most aspects of this
file handling. A configured DocumentStore object is available as the
``store`` property on any DocumentRepository object.

Example: If a created docrepo object ``d`` has the alias ``foo``, and
handles a document with the basefile identifier ``bar``, data about
the document is then stored:

* When downloaded, the original data as retrieved from the remote
  server, is stored as ``data/foo/downloaded/bar.html``, as determined
  by ``d.store.``:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentStore.downloaded_path`

* At the same time, a DocumentEntry object is serialized as
  ``data/foo/entries/bar.json``, as determined by
  ``d.store.``:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentStore.documententry_path`

* If the downloaded source needs to be transformed into some
  intermediate format before parsing (which is the case for eg. PDF or
  Word documents), the intermediate data is stored as
  ``data/foo/intermediate/bar.xml``, as determined by
  ``d.store.``:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentStore.intermediate_path`

* When the downloaded data has been parsed, the parsed XHTML+RDFa
  document is stored as ``data/foo/parsed/bar.xhtml``, as determined
  by ``d.store.``:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentStore.parsed_path`

* From the parsed document is automatically destilled a RDF/XML file
  containing all RDFa statements from the parsed file, which is stored
  as ``data/foo/distilled/bar.rdf``, as determined by ``d.store.``
  ``data/foo/annotations/bar.grit.txt``, as determined by
  ``d.store.``:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentStore.annotation_path`.

* During the ``relate`` step, all documents which are referred to by
  any other document are marked as dependencies of that document. If
  the ``bar`` document is dependent on another document, then this
  dependency is recorded in a dependency file stored at
  ``data/foo/deps/bar.txt``, as determined by
  ``d.store.``:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentStore.dependencies_path`.

* Just prior to the generation of browser-ready HTML5 files, all
  metadata in the system as a whole which is relevant to ``bar`` is
  serialized in an annotation file in GRIT/XML format at
  ``data/foo/annotations/bar.grit.txt``, as determined by
  ``d.store.``:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentStore.annotation_path`.

* Finally, the generated HTML5 file is created at
  ``data/foo/generated/bar.html``, as determined by
  ``d.store.``:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentStore.generated_path`. (This
  step also updates the serialized DocumentEntry object described
  above)


Archiving 
^^^^^^^^^

Whenever a new version of an existing document is downloaded, an
archiving process takes place when
:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentStore.archive` is called (by
:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentRepository.download_if_needed`). This method
requires a version id, which can be any string that uniquely
identifies a certain revision of the document. When called, all of the
above files are moved into the subdirectory in the following way
(assuming that the version id is "42"):

The result of this process is that a version id for the previously
existing files is calculated (by default, this is just a simple
incrementing integer, but the document in your docrepo might have a
more suitable version identifier already, in which case you should
override :py:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentRepository.get_archive_version` to
return this), and then all the above files (if they have been
generated) are moved into the subdirectory ``archive`` in the
following way.

``data/foo/downloaded/bar.html`` -> ``data/foo/archive/downloaded/bar/42.html``

The method :py:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentRepository.get_archive_version` is
used to calculate the version id. The default implementation just
provides a simple incrementing integer, but if the documents in your
docrepo has a more suitable version identifier already, you should
override :py:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentRepository.get_archive_version` to
return this.

The archive path is calculated by providing the optional ``version``
parameter to any of the ``*_path`` methods above.

To list all archived versions for a given basefile, use the
:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentStore.list_versions` method.

The ``open_*`` methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In many cases, you don't really need to know the filename that the
``*_path`` methods return, because you only want to read from or write to
it. For these cases, you can use the ``open_*`` methods instead. These
work as context managers just as the builtin open method do, and can
be used in the same way:

Instead of:

.. literalinclude:: examples/keyconcepts-file.py
   :start-after: # begin path
   :end-before: # end path


use:

.. literalinclude:: examples/keyconcepts-file.py
   :start-after: # begin open
   :end-before: # end open


Attachments
^^^^^^^^^^^

In many cases, a single file cannot represent the entirety of a
document. For example, a downloaded HTML file may need a series of
inline images. These can be handled as attachments by the download
method. Just use the optional attachment parameter to the appropriate
*_path / open_* methods:

.. literalinclude:: examples/keyconcepts-attachments.py
   :language: python		    
   :lines: 2-14,18-22	    

.. note:: 

   The DocumentStore object must be configured to handle attachments
   by setting the ``storage_policy`` property to ``dir``. This alters
   the behaviour of all ``*_path`` methods, so that eg. the main
   downloaded path becomes ``data/foo/downloaded/bar/index.html``
   instead of ``data/foo/downloaded/bar.html``

To list all attachments for a document, use
:meth:`~ferenda.DocumentStore.list_attachments` method.

Note that only some of the ``*_path`` / ``open_*`` methods supports the
``attachment`` parameter (it doesn't make sense to have attachments for
DocumentEntry files or distilled RDF/XML files).
