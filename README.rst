Ferenda is a python library and framework for transforming
unstructured document collections into structured Linked Data. It
helps with downloading documents, parsing them to add explicit
semantic structure and RDF-based metadata, finding relationships
between documents, and publishing the results.

Quick start
-----------

This example uses ferenda's project framework to download the 50
latest RFCs and W3C standards, parse documents into structured,
RDF-enabled XHTML documents, loads all RDF metadata into a triplestore
and generates a web site of static HTML5 files that are usable
offline::

    pip install --extra-index-url https://testpypi.python.org/pypi ferenda
    ferenda-setup myproject
    cd myproject
    ./ferenda-build.py ferenda.sources.tech.RFC enable
    ./ferenda-build.py ferenda.sources.tech.W3Standards enable
    ./ferenda-build.py all all --downloadmax=50 --staticsite --fulltextindex=False
    open data/index.html

The same functionality can also be accessed through a python API, if
you want to use ferenda as part of a larger system. It's also possible
to just use the parts of ferenda that you need (eg. only the
downloading and parsing features).
